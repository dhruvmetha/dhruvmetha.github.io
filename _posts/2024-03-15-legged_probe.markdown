PROBE introduces a transformer based system that predicts 2D planar obstacles in the environment only from the robot's interaction with the obstacles. The transformer uses only the history of the robot's proprioceptive states (joint positions, joint velocities, torques applied on the joints and robot pose) for this prediction.
