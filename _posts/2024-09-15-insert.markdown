This work addresses precise (<1mm) object insertion tasks by combining model-based control with residual RL, enabling zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality without fine-tuning. The integrated policy outperforms state-of-the-art RL and hybrid approaches, validated through simulations and real-world tests.
